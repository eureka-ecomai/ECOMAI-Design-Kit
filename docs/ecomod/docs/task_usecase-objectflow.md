# ECOMOD Task: Model Object Flow


## Description

### Motivation

DThe consideration of the incoming and outgoing (data) objects of the process steps sharpens their description and provides important information for the system architecture, e.g. for the description of interfaces.

### What's To Do

Model the incoming and outgoing (data) objects of the individual use case steps and their relationships.

#### Guiding Questions

+ Which (data) objects are required by a use case step?
+ Which (data) objects are created or changed by a use case step?

### How To Do

So-called _action pins_ are added to the actions of the activities to describe the incoming and outgoing (data) objects.

#### Used Model Objects

+ Views: `UML Actvity Diagram`
+ Elements: `UML ActivityParameter`, `UML ActionPin`
+ Relationships: `UML ObjectFlow`

### Next Steps

Object flow adds a level of detail to the model that can be used for simulations and automated consistency checks.
