# ECOMOD Task: Describe Use Case Essentials


## Description

### Motivation

We need an overview of the system's services that can be determined quickly and is independent of technical solutions.

### What's To Do

Describe the technical intent of the use case in the form of essential steps; the technical details and specific processes are not taken into account.

#### Guiding Questions

+ What is the technical intention of the use case?
+ Does the essential description contain technical solutions?
+ Has an essential step the same name as an use case?
+ Is the essential description understandable for an expert but unfamiliar with the project?
+ Does the use case have 2-8 essential steps?
+ What exceptions can occur during the process?
+ Which variants can occur during the process?

### How To Do

Think about the steps of the standard flow of a use case and abstract the technical details so that they are no longer included in the description. Identify the possible exceptions and variants in the standard flow of a use case.

#### Used Model Objects

+ Views: `UML UseCase Diagram`
+ Elements: `UML UseCase`, `UML Note`
+ Relationships: `UML Link`

### Next Steps

The essential steps provide the structure of the next level of detail. The description is stable and can be reused for subsequent or related systems, e.g. in a product family.
