# ECOMOD Product: Domain Knowledge

The **_Domain Knowledge_** lists the _Domain Objects_ used by the _Use Case Activities_ and _Requirements_.


## Purpose

The **_Domain Knowledge_** describes those objects of the domain that are used by the system, together with their structure and related value types and units.


## Description

A _Domain Object_ could be data or a physical entity, which are the inputs and outputs of the system functions. The object flows of the _Use Case Activities_ define the usage of these _Domain Objects_ by the system. The definition of a _Domain Object_ typically includes its internal structure and the required value types and units.

The **_Domain Knowledge_** provides answers to the following primary questions about the system model:

+ Which domain objects must be used by the system?
+ Which value types and units must be used by the system?

The **_Domain Knowledge_** can also provide answers to other questions:

+ How are the domain objects structured?
+ What are the relations between the domain objects?
+ Which system actor delivers a domain object?
+ Which system actor receives a domain object?

The ECOMOD product **_Domain Knowledge_** essentially consists of the following parts:

+ a catalog containing the Domain Objects
+ a catalog containing the domain-specific value types and units
+ a view depicting the Domain Objects and the relations between them


## Representation

The _Domain Objects_ are depicted in a **SysML Block Diagram** and pictured either as **SysML Block** or **UML Class**. The linking between **Domain Objects** is pictured with **discipline-specific SysML/UML relationships**.
