# ECOMOD Task: Model Internal Interfaces

!!TODO!!
Identify the specific points at the system components through which the components interacts with their environment.


## Description

### Motivation

!!TODO!!
The interaction points describe the interfaces of a system component to its environment and are responsible for successful system solution.

### What's To Do

!!TODO!!
Describe the points of the system components through which interaction with their environment takes place.

#### Guiding Questions

!!TODO!!
+ What interaction points and interfaces do the building blocks have?
+ Which services are offered via the interaction points?
+ Which services are requested via the interaction points?

### How To Do

!!TODO!!
For each system component identify the interaction points and specify the services and information items that are offered or requested via that point.


#### Used Model Objects

!!TODO!!
+ Views: `IoT-PML System Decomposition Diagram`
+ Elements: `IoT-PML stereotype «hwComponent»`, `IoT-PML stereotype «swComponent»`, `IoT-PML stereotype «Interaction Point»`
+ Relationships: `IoT-PML stereotype «Connector»`

### Next Steps

!!TODO!!
The base for describing the flow of information between the system building blocks are the interaction points of the system components.


## Inputs

!!TODO!!
+ [System Architecture](product_system-architecture.md)

## Outputs

!!TODO!!
+ [System Architecture](product_system-architecture.md) _enriched with:_
  - Component Interfaces View, Component Interface Catalog, Component Connections


## Recommendations & Tips

_None._
