# ECOMOD Product: System Modes

The **_System Modes_** describe the relevant conditions of the system or its building blocks.


## Purpose

The **_System Modes_** describe the behavior of the system and its parts, and they are the pre- and postconditions of system functions.


## Description

The **_System Modes_** are used to specify the behavior of parts of the system, including the system itself. A state represents a condition and specifies the reaction if an event is received. Such a reaction could be the execution of a function, or the transition to another state, or both of them.

The **_System Modes_** are part of the behavior specification of an architecture.

_Please note, that in the context of the System Use Cases states are part of a System Process._

The **_System Modes_** provides answers to the following primary questions about the system model:

+ How does the system react to events?
+ Which system blocks react to events and how?

The **_System Modes_** can also provide answers to other questions:

+ Which pre- and postconditions exists in the system?


## Representation

The _System Modes_ are depicted in a **SysML State Diagram** and pictured as **SysML State**. The linking between the _System Modes_ is pictured with **SysML Transition** relationships.
