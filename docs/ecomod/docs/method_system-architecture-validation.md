## Purpose

#### ---ORIGINAL---begin---
A Scenario maps a path through an Use Case Activity to an architecture and tests if all necessary parts, structures, and interfaces are properly defined.
#### ---ORIGINAL---end---


## Description

#### ---ORIGINAL---begin---
The Scenarios describe the collaboration of system parts to perform paths through the Use Case Activities. A path is one valid order of execution of the functions of a Use Case Activity. Each function is implemented by one or more parts and connections of the architecture.

The Scenario describes the messages that are sent from one part to another, which part performs which function and which connection between the parts are necessary.
