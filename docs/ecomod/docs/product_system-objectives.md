The **_System Objectives_** lists the goals of the owner of the system. A goal is understood to be a desirable state that lies in the future and whose occurrence depends on certain actions or omissions, and therefore does not occur automatically.


## Purpose

The **_System Objectives_** are used to trace the rationale of the requirements and to communicate the goals of the system development to the persons that are building the system model.

A goal setting is essential for the success of a project. But when setting goals for the overall system a division of the system into hardware and software should not be anticipated.


## Description

Typically, the goals of the system development are documented outside of the development project. The **_System Objectives_** are a revision of these goals, particularly for the system development phase.

The **_System Objectives_** provides answers to the following primary questions about the system model:

+ What are the goals of the owner of the system?
+ What are the goals of the system development?

The **_System Objectives_** can also provide answers to other questions:

+ What are the non-goals of the system development?

(_Note: It is not common practice to note non-goals, but possible if necessary._)


## Representation

The identified **_System Objectives_** are depicted in a **SysML Requirements Diagram** and pictured with the **ECOMOD stereotype «Objective»**.
