# ECOMOD Product: System System Architecture Scenarios

The **_System Architecture Scenarios_** describe concrete collaborations of _System Actors_ and system parts to perform a system function.


## Purpose

For a specific system function, an _Architecture Scenario_ is used to verify whether all system parts and connections are present.


## Description

An _Architecture Scenario_ describes how parts of the system collaborate to perform a single path through a system function. Specifying an _Architecture Scenario_ verfies if all necessary system parts are identified and connections between them are properly defined in the model. The modeler performs a virtual tour through the system and checks if everything is in place. Therefore, the **_System Architecture Scenarios_** takes into account all system functions. 


The **_System Architecture Scenarios_** provides answers to the following primary questions about the system model:

+ Are all necessary system parts identified?
+ Are all the necessary connections available between the system parts?

The **_System Architecture Scenarios_** can also provide answers to other questions:

+ How a system function is realized in the system solution?


## Representation

The interactions done in an _System Architecture Scenario_ are depicted in a **SysML Sequence Diagram**. The partners involved in that interactions are pictured as classified **SysML Lifelines**, the interactions itself are pictured as a sequence of **SysML Messages**.
