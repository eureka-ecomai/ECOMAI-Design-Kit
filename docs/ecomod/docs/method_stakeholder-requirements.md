# SYSMOD Method: Model Stakeholder Requirements

Document the functional properties that have to be satisfied by the system from the stakeholders' perspective.


## Motivation

It's important to know what the system has to do from the stakeholders' perspective.


## Description

### What's To Do

The _Stakeholders_ are the source of the system functionality. You receive the requirements as documents, as an outcome of workshops, a result of a discussion, in form of a presentation, and so on.

Document all the functional properties that specify what the system has to do by using the SOPHIST's [MASTER Template](glossary.md#-m-).

For complete documentation, at least the following information about a _Stakeholder Requirement_ are required:
+ **Concern**: What concerns does the stakeholder have regarding the system to be developed?
+ **Category**: Classification of a stakeholder into categories, for example _expert_, _requirements owner_, _system user_.
+ **Contact Person**: If we have a stakeholder who cannot be addressed directly (such as a customer), we need a contact person; for important contacts (priority 1), deputies are also interesting.

Each identified _Stakeholder Requirement_ is stored in the system model by using an ECOMOD stereotype that includes all the properties described above.

### How To Do

The _Stakeholder Requirements_ are depicted typically in a **SysML Requirements Diagram** and pictured with the **ECOMOD stereotype «FunctionalReqt»**.

The _Stakeholder Requirements_ shall be linked to the _Stakeholders_ to obtain a source for informal needs. They shall also have traceable relationships with those _System Objectives_ which are satisfied by them.

In a later step the _System Use Cases_ shall be linked to the _Stakeholder Requirements_ to obtain a source for informal needs.


### Next Steps

The _Stakeholder Requirements_ are direct or indirect input information for further steps of system development.
