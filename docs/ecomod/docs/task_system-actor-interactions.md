# ECOMOD Task: Model System/Actor Interactions

Describe the interaction between the system and its actors.

## Description

### Motivation

The system context and system use cases do not consider in detail the interaction between the system and the system actors, which can lead to misjudgments of usability and system integration.

### What's To Do

Describe the interactions between the system and the system actors, each related to a system use case.

#### Guiding Questions

+ Which requests are sent by actors to the system during a use case flow?
+ Which requests are sent by the system to the actors during a use case flow?
+ Who carries out which request and when?

### How To Do

The interaction between the system and the system actors is described in a sequence diagram for selected use case scenario.

#### Used Model Objects

+ Views: `UML Sequence Diagram`
+ Elements: `UML Lifeline`, `UML CombinedFragment`
+ Relationships: `UML Message` 

### Next Steps

The system/actor interactions provide a template for the design, especially for defining system interfaces.
