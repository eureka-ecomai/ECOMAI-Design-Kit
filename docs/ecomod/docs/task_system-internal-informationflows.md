# ECOMOD Task: Model Internal Information Flows

!!TODO!!
Describe the flow of information between the interfaces of the system building blocks.


## Description

### Motivation

!!TODO!!
For a clear understanding of the system architecture, the information flow between the system components is helpful.

### What's To Do

!!TODO!!
Describe the information items that the system components exchange among themselves.

#### Guiding Questions

!!TODO!!
+ What information is exchanged between the blocks?
+ What information is required by a block?
+ What information can a building block provide?

### How To Do

!!TODO!!
For each identified system component, the relevant information items that it send to or receive from other components are noted.

#### Used Model Objects

!!TODO!!
+ Views: `IoT-PML System Decomposition Diagram`
+ Elements: `IoT-PML stereotype «hwComponent»`, `IoT-PML stereotype «swComponent»`, `IoT-PML stereotype «Interaction Point»`, `IoT-PML InformationItem`
+ Relationships: `UML InformationFlow`

### Next Steps

!!TODO!!
In the design, the information flows are used to describe the component interfaces. The system architecture must reflect the information flows inside the system.


## Inputs

!!TODO!!
+ [System Architecture](product_system-architecture.md)

## Outputs

!!TODO!!
+ [System Architecture](product_system-architecture.md) _enriched with:_
  - Component Interfaces View, Internal Information Catalog, Internal Information Flows


## Recommendations & Tips

_None._
