# External Product: Functional Architecture

#### ---ORIGINAL---begin---
The **_Functional Architecture_** consists of functional elements, functional interfaces and flows, and architecture decisions.
#### ---ORIGINAL---end---


## Purpose

#### ---ORIGINAL---begin---
The **_Functional Architecture_** strengthens the functional aspect and is a technology-independent functional description of the system.
#### ---ORIGINAL---end---


## Description

#### ---ORIGINAL---begin---
The functional elements transforms input flows into output flows. The functional interfaces are attached to the functional elements and specify the allowed input and output flows. Connectors between the functional elements specify the flow paths.

The **_Functional Architecture_** is derived from functional requirements, for example, from the Use Case Activities with the FAS method. Relative to the requirements the **_Functional Architecture_** is independent of the technical components. However, it depends on the technical components of the Base Architecture.

The _Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge_ defines the **_Functional Architecture_** as _"[...] a set of functions and their sub-functions that defines the transformations of input flows into output flows performed by the system to archieve its mission."_. The definition is adapted from the ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-4 standard. It is conform to the definition used here and by the FAS method.

The **_Functional Architecture_** is not a full product of SYSMOD. It is described here to provide a docking point for other methods like the FAS method.
