The **_Stakeholders_** lists persons and organizations that are interested in or effected by the system.


## Purpose

A person and organization that are interested in or effected by the system is so-called _Stakeholder_. To address its concerns and build a system that meets all of its needs we need a complete list of them.


## Description

A _Stakeholder_ could be a person in a specific role or any kind of organization (e.g. a company department or government agency). Such a _Stakeholder_ has interests, needs, concerns or doubt about the system, or is effected by the system. It is important to know all those persons, together with their specific interests, needs, concerns or doubt, to specify proper requirements and build a system that satisfy those requirements.

The **_Stakeholders_** provides answers to the following primary questions about the system model:

+ Who is interested in the system?
+ Who is effected by the system?
+ Who is using the system?

The **_Stakeholders_** can also provide answers to other questions:

+ Who sets which goal?
+ Who demands which requirement?
+ Who affects the system directly?
+ Who affects the system indirectly?
+ Who is the source of a goal?
+ Who is the source of a requirement?

Each _Stakeholder_, that directly affects the system, shall have a traceable relationship to the system. An example for a directly affecting _Stakeholder_ is the owner or a user of the system; an example for a indirectly affecting _Stakeholder_ is an authority that publish laws, standards or rules which affects the system.

The _System Requirements_ shall have traceable relationships with those _Stakeholders_ which are the source of information for them.

The _Stakeholders_ shall have traceable relationships with those _System Objectives_ in which they are interested.


## Representation

A _Stakeholder_ are depicted typically in a **SysML Requirements Diagram** and pictured with the **ECOMOD stereotype «Stakeholder»**. The linking between _Stakeholders_ and _System Objectives_ are pictured with the **SysML Trace** relationship.
