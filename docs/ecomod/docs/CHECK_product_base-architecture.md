# ECOMOD Product: Base Architecture

The **_Basic Architecture_** describes the architectural and technical decisions that were made at the beginning of the development project.


## Purpose

The **_Base Architecture_** documents the architectural and technical decisions that are the obligatory constraints for the further system development. The _Requirements_ are based on it and it sets the limits within which new innovative solutions can be developed.


## Description

The **_Basic Architecture_** represents the fundamental architecture of the system, which was determined before the start of the development project, including the relevant external units of the environment, the necessary system interfaces and the required system parts. The technologies of the _Base Architecture_ may be used in the requirements because they are not part of the solution space, but rather limit it.

The **_Base Architecture_** provides answers to the following primary questions about the system model:

+ Which external entities should the system interact with?
+ What parts should the system consist of?
+ Which interfaces should the system have?

The **_Base Architecture_** can also provide answers to other questions:

+ Which parts of the system should communicate with which external units?
+ Which parts of the system should be responsible for which system interfaces?
+ How should the parts of the system be connected?

The **_Base Architecture_** is depicted in formal kind as a part of the system model.


## Representation

The _Base Architecture_ is depicted typically in a combination of a **SysML Block Definition Diagram** and a **SysML Internal Block Diagram** and pictured either with **SysML BLock** elements or **descipline-specific ECOMOD stereotypes**.
